## üöÄ Core Features

This application includes a robust set of features designed for a seamless user experience:

*   **Secure User Authentication:** Full email/password sign-up and sign-in flow powered by Nhost Auth, including email verification for new users. Social sign-in with Google and GitHub is also supported.
*   **Protected Routes:** All application features are restricted to authenticated users.
*   **Real-Time Chat:** A fully featured chat interface with a chat list and message view. New messages from the user and the bot appear in real-time using GraphQL Subscriptions.
*   **AI-Powered Responses:** Chatbot responses are generated by a secure, backend n8n workflow that calls the OpenRouter API. The frontend never calls the AI directly.
*   **GraphQL-Only Communication:** The frontend communicates with the backend exclusively through GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
*   **Row-Level Security:** Database permissions are configured in Hasura to ensure users can only ever access their own chats and messages.
*   **Fully Responsive Design:** A modern UI that works seamlessly on all screen sizes, featuring a collapsible sidebar on desktop and a slide-out drawer on mobile.
*   **Dark & Light Theme:** A theme toggle allows users to switch between light and dark modes.
*   **Polished User Experience:** Includes features like a "Bot is typing..." indicator, automatic view switching on new chat creation, and responsive typography and spacing.

    *   You can create your own by copying the example file:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env.local
      ```
    *   Open the newly created `.env.local` file.
    *   You will need to get your **Subdomain** and **Region** from your Nhost project dashboard.
    *   Replace the placeholder values in the `.env.local` file:
      ```
      REACT_APP_NHOST_SUBDOMAIN=your-nhost-subdomain-goes-here
      REACT_APP_NHOST_REGION=your-nhost-region-goes-here
      ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
